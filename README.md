Creating common computer chips from scratch: https://www.nand2tetris.org/project01

These are tested using the HDL programming language that was designed for the nand2tetris course. 
The software used for testing can be found: https://www.nand2tetris.org/software
The elementary logic gate used is the NAND gate. From this gate, the 15 additional gates in this repo (the .hdl files) are constructed from scratch. These 15 gates are the bui8lding blocks that will be used in the next parts of the course to construct a computer.
